# **App Name**: GÖSA_Reiseplaner

## Core Features:

- Map Display: Display an interactive map using Leaflet.js, initialized with the user-provided coordinates and tile layer.
- Address Search: Implement a search bar for users to enter addresses and use geocoding to translate them into coordinates.
- Marker Placement: Place a marker on the map at the coordinates derived from the address search.
- Route calculation: Add the functionality to calculate a route between the user's current location and the marker set after the address search.  The application uses a tool to determine whether the route is viable.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#43B5E0), evokes a sense of exploration and clarity, in keeping with the cartographic purpose.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5), nearly white, provides a clean, neutral backdrop for the map.
- Accent color: Cyan (#4AC9FF) provides interactive elements for focus.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear and simple icons for map controls and search functionalities.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with the search bar prominently placed.
